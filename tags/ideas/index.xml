      <description>At school we were told to make a mobile app for android. The teacher said we can use Java, because this is for the lecture of OO Programming 2, the OO Programming 1 was about basic Java SE. For this lecture we will develop mobile app alone not in a team. I proposed to my teacher if i can used React Native for developing later and he said yes. So, i run into React Native page and set up for local dev.</description>
