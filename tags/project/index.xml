      <description>I have a project with my friends for MTQMN DAQ. It&amp;rsquo;s an android app with a feature kind of to detect your recitation. It&amp;rsquo;s still WIP and i worked on the android development, while my friends work on Machine Learning and as a project manager. This project is challenging, because i am new to android development and trying to make a good decision about architecture and design is not easy. I need to read more about design pattern, RxJava2, and material design.</description>
