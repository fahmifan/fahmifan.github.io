      <description>So, i just tried Hugo and it was super easy to build static web. The installation is faster and easier compare to jekyll. The build time is also fast. Will try to explore later. The deploy is easy, you only need to write some script there is example from Hugo if you using Unix, and then run the script. If you using Github for User , after the script run then it will push into the master branch and finally updated into your github pages.</description>

      <description>At school we were told to make a mobile app for android. The teacher said we can use Java, because this is for the lecture of OO Programming 2, the OO Programming 1 was about basic Java SE. For this lecture we will develop mobile app alone not in a team. I proposed to my teacher if i can used React Native for developing later and he said yes. So, i run into React Native page and set up for local dev.</description>
